## Loss Development Model - Damped Harmonic Oscilator
### Over Damped: Cummulative Development Factor = 1-(C)e^(-at)-(1-C)e^(-bt)
### Under Damped: Cummulative Development Factor =  1-(C)sin(at)e^(-bt)-cos(at)e^(-bt)
### Critically Damped: Cummulative Development Factor =  1-(C)te^(-at)-e^(-at)

## Amount of insurance model factors
### Factor(L) = (e(1-e(-L/S))-1)/(e(1-e(-L(b)/S))-1)

## Deductibles by amount of insurance factors
### Factor(L) = (e(1-e(-L/S))-e(1-e(-D/S)))/(e(1-e(-L(b)/S))-e(1-e(-D(b)/S)))

## Increased Limits Model
### Occurance Limit = Claim Limit ex 500/500 or 500CSL
### Occurance Limit = 2xClaim Limit ex 250/500
### Occurance Limit = 3xClaim Limit ex 100/300

## Homeowners Catastrophe Model (aggregate)
Mean of aggregate distribution = mean(f)*mean(s)
Variance of aggregate distribution
𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝐴𝑔𝑔𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡)=∑𝑛=1∞(𝑛𝐸(𝑆2))+𝑛(𝑛−1)𝐸(𝑆)2−2𝑛𝐸(𝑆)𝐸(𝐴𝑔𝑔𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛)+𝐸(𝐴𝑔𝑔𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛)2)(((𝑟+𝑛−1𝑛))𝑝𝑛(1−𝑝)𝑟).
 
Where:
E(S) = Mean of Severity distribution.

E(S^2) = Second Moment of the Severity Distribution about the origin.

n = number of events r = number of successes.

E(AggMean) = is short hand for the aggregate mean
𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛(𝐴𝑔𝑔𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡)=𝑟𝑝1−𝑝(𝛼𝐴𝑂𝐼)(Γ(1+1𝑑)).
